**(PLEASE DELETE ALL THESE AFTER READING)**

Thank you for the pull request! `you-get` is a growing open source project, which would not have been possible without contributors like you.

Here are some simple rules to follow, please recheck them before sending the pull request:

- [ ] If you want to propose two or more unrelated patches, please open separate pull requests for them, instead of one;
- [ ] All pull requests should be based upon the latest `develop` branch;
- [ ] Name your branch (from which you will send the pull request) properly; use a meaningful name like `add-this-shining-feature` rather than just `develop`;
- [ ] All commit messages, as well as comments in code, should be written in understandable English.

As a contributor, you must be aware that

- [ ] You agree to contribute your code to this project, under the terms of the MIT license, so that any person may freely use or redistribute them; of course, you will still reserve the copyright for your own authorship.
- [ ] You may not contribute any code not authored by yourself, unless they are licensed under either public domain or the MIT license, literally.

Not all pull requests can eventually be merged. I consider merged / unmerged patches as equally important for the community: as long as you think a patch would be helpful, someone else might find it helpful, too, therefore they could take your fork and benefit in some way. In any case, I would like to thank you in advance for taking your time to contribute to this project.

Cheers,
Mort
