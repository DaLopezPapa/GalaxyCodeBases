<H1> CSC 120 - Computer Science for the Sciences (R section, L0201, 
     Jan-Apr 2016) </H1>

<B>The handout for Assignment 1 is now available below, and a
clarifying note is also below.  Note that it is due at the start of
lecture February 26, three days later than originally scheduled.

<P>Office hours on February 25 will be from 2:30 to 3:30.

<P>Remember that there is a Quiz on February 26!

<P>INSTRUCTION FOR HANDING IN ASSIGNMENT 1:

<P>You should hand in your assignment by emailing it to<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>radford@cdf.utoronto.ca</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You should NOT email your assignment to any other email address.
In particular, you should NOT send it to my regular email address for
other course correspondence.

<P>Your email should have the following subject line:<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>A1, 9999999999, Lastname, Firstname</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Here, 9999999999 is your student ID number, Lastname is your family name,
and Firstname is your given name.

<P>The body of your email can be anything.  (It could be
a note to me if you have some reason to say something.)

<P>Your email should have five attachments:<UL>
<LI>The R script file containing your function definitions, called a1funs.r
<LI>The R script file that runs <TT>find_pairings</TT> on the test data,
    called a1script.r
<LI>The text output of this script, which should give the total distance
    found after improving each random pairing, called a1out.txt
<LI>The PDF file for the plot of pairings obtained using ten random pairings 
    with the random seed set to 1, called a1plot1.pdf
<LI>The plot of pairings obtained using one random pairing with the random
    set to your student ID number, called a1plot2.pdf
</UL>

<P>You can create a text file with the text output by creating a text
file with File &gt; New File &gt; Text File in RStudio, then copying
and pasting into it.

<P>You can create a file with a plot using the Export menu in the RStudio
plot window (choose "as PDF").  You can move back and forth between 
multiple plots using the left and right arrows in the plot window.

<P>CSC 120 L0201 is an introduction to programming using the R language,
which is widely used for statistical applications.  It is designed for
students with no programming experience, who are either planning to
specialize in statistics or who expect to use statistics extensively
while studying other fields.  

<P>Students in other areas of science may wish to take <A
HREF="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~drosu/csc120-winter2016.html">section
L0101 of CSC 120</A>, which uses the Python language.  Students who
plan on taking further courses in CS may wish to take CSC 108 instead
of CSC 120, and then take CSC 148.  It is possible to take CSC 148
after CSC 120 without taking CSC 108, but to do so you will have to
pick up some material on your own.

<B>Email:</B> 
<A HREF="mailto:radford@cs.utoronto.ca">radford@cs.utoronto.ca</A>

<P><B>Office hours:</B> Thursdays, 2:10 to 3:00, in SS6026A.

<P><B>Lectures and Tutorials/Labs:</B></P>
<blockquote>
Lectures: Tuesdays and Fridays, 3:10-4:00pm, MP202. <BR>
Tutorials/Labs: Wednesdays, 1:10-3:00, CDF lab, room BA3185 (& others).

<P>Labs will start January 13.
The lab the first week will be to make sure you know how to log
into the CDF computers, start up R using Rstudio, and do simple things in R.
If you have a laptop computer, you should bring it, so you can also learn
how to install R and Rstudio on it.  Later labs will involve
non-credit excercises, which will prepare you for assignments,
quizzes, and the exam.
</blockquote>

<P><B>Evaluation:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  21% - Three 30-minute quizzes (7% each), written during lectures
        on January 29, February 26, and March 18.<BR>
  30% - Three assignments (10% each), due at start of lectures
        on February 26, March 22, and April 8.<BR>
  49% - Final exam (scheduled by the Faculty).  

<P><B>You must get at least 40% on the final exam to pass the course</B>.
If you don't, your final grade will be less than 50 regardless of your
other grades in this course.

<P>Assignments will be done by students individually.

<P>Assignments may be handed in late by the date and time specified 
   on the handout with a 20% penalty.  Later assignments will not be accepted.

<P>Students with a <B>valid</B> medical or other excuse will of course not 
   be penalized for late assignments, or for missing a quiz.
   You must, however, contact the instructor (eg, by email) as soon as possible
   (preferrably beforehand) if you are not able to hand in an assignment 
   or write a quiz.

<P><B>Getting and Using R:</B>
<blockquote>
<P>You will use R via Rstudio on the <A HREF="http://www.cdf.utoronto.ca">CDF
computer system</A>, on which you should automatically have an account
if you are registered in this course.  To start Rstudio,
you need to open a terminal window, and then type "rstudio".

<P>You can also install R and Rstudio (for free) on your own laptop or
desktop computer.  You can download R from <A
HREF="http://r-project.org">r-project.org</A>, and
Rstudio from <A HREF="http://rstudio.com">rstudio.com</A>.

<P>The lab in the first week (January 13, 1:10-3:00pm) will help you get
started on these things.

  <TT>find_pairings</TT> function should, for each random set of initial
  pairings, call <TT>improve_pairings</TT> repeatedly (not just once), until 
  <TT>improve_pairings</TT> is not able to reduce the total distance.
