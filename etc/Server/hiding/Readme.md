## Usage

Upload `autorun`, `run`, `h32`, `h64` and your `bash` to a directory like `~/.cache/abrt/.test`.

Execute `autorun` to generate `dir`, `cron` and `upd` and add item to `crontab`.

Now you got your `bash` run as “[bash]”.

HOWEVER, if other human user login and run `top`, he or she will find you taking up all CPU and contact the root to kill you with '9'. (`kill -9 xxx`)

So, pray for there is no more human activties.
