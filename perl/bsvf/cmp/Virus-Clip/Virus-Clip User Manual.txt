Section I.	Preliminary preparation

a) Downloading the human and virus reference genome
User should get ready the human (human.fa) and virus (virus.fa) reference genome in FASTA format.

b) Installation of BWA (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)
User should choose the latest version of BWA (currently 0.7.10). Following the instructions from the provider. BWA-MEM will be used by Virus-Clip. Index should be built for the virus reference genome using the following command:
bwa index virus.fa
The index generated should be placed under the same directory as the virus reference genome.

c) Installation of SAMTools (http://www.htslib.org/)
User should choose the latest version of SAMTools (currently 1.1). Following the instructions from the provider.

d) Installation of standalone BLAST (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/LATEST/)
User should choose the latest version of standalone BLAST (currently 2.2.30). Following the instructions at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52640/ for installation. BLASTN will be used by Virus-Clip. BLAST database should be built for the human reference genome using the following command:
makeblastdb -in human.fa -dbtype nucl -out human
The BLAST database generated should be placed under the same directory as the human reference genome.

e) Installation of ANNOVAR (http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/)
User should choose the latest version of ANNOVAR (currently 2015Jan06). Following the instructions from the provider.

f) Creating the home directory for Virus-Clip result
User should create home directory (e.g. /virus_clip) for Virus-Clip execution. Under this directory, sub-directories of align (e.g. /virus_clip/align) and result (e.g. /virus_clip/result) should be made. These 2 sub-directories will store the read alignment and viral integration detection result respectively.

Section II. Suggested working procedures

Step 1.
Setting the path and parameter information in virus_clip.sh
Users should amend the parameters in the shell script BEFORE the execution of the script.
In the tools section of the script, user should fill in the path information for:
1. BWA executable
2. SAMTools executable
3. virus_clip.pl (provided in Virus-Clip)
4. BLASTN executable
5. ANNOVAR annotate_variation.pl

In the resources section of the script, user should fill in the path information for:
1. Virus reference genome (virus.fa)
2. BLAST database for human reference genome
3. ANNOVAR database for refGene

In the parameter section of the script, user should fill in the information for:
1. Sequence read file suffix (e.g. .fastq.gz)

Step 2.
Executing virus_clip.sh
User can execute virus_clip.sh through the following command:
bash virus_clip.sh path_to_seq_data path_to_result xxx library_flag

where
path_to_seq_data	Path to directory storing sequence file
path_to_result		Path to home directory for Virus-Clip result
xxx			Name prefix of the sequence file
library_flag		1 for single-end, 2 for paired-end
For single-end data, the sequence file should be named as xxx.fastq.gz. For paired-end data, the 2 sequence files should be named as xxx_1.fastq.gz and xxx_2.fastq.gz. Read alignment in SAM format  (xxx.bwa.sam) will be created under the align sub-directory. Directory with name prefix of the sequence file will be created under the result sub-directory (e.g. /virus_clip/result/xxx) and Virus-Clip output file (virus_clip.out) will be generated, which stores the viral integration events detected.

Section III.	virus_clip.out file format (tab-delimited text)

Column 1	Left element of the integration event
Column 2	Chromosome for the left element
Column 3	Breakpoint position for the left element
Column 4	Sequence for the left element
Column 5	Right element of the integration event
Column 6	Chromosome for the right element
Column 7	Breakpoint position for the right element
Column 8	Sequence for the right element
Column 9	Supporting soft-clipped read count
Column 10	Affected human gene region
Column 11	Affected human gene
