There are 5 programs in this directory, used to draw the sperm crossover and recombinate rate figures

1. Draw the crossovers by each sperm
   draw_sperm_real_coor_final_curate_by_sperm.pl

2. Draw the crossovers by each chromosome
   draw_sperm_real_coor_final_curate_by_chr.pl

3. Draw the crossovers on PAR
   draw_sperm_real_coor_final_curate_by_chr_par.pl

4. Draw recombination rate distribution figure
   draw_recomb_rate_final_3T.pl    (3T, means the window size is 3 times of shift distance)

5. Draw recombination rate distribution figure
   draw_recomb_rate_final_3T_correct.pl  (reads the marker-density-increased hapmap and decode files)
