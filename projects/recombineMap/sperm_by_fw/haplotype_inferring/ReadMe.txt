There are 3 perl programs developed to phase hetSNPs and infer the diploid haplotypes:

1. Inferring by sperm linkage:
   
   (1) infer_haplotype.pl
  
   (2) phase_more_by_sperm.pl

2. Inferring by trio transmission:
   
   (1) infer_trio_haplo.pl


The usage of these programs can be found in the belowing shells:
   
   infer_haplotype.sh
   
   phase_more.sh
   
   trio_analysis.sh
