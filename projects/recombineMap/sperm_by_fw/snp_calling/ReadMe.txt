There are two softare in this package:

1. pkusnp, a univerval snp calling software, based on the bayes theory, and can be used to infer SNPs
  of diploid or haploid genome by comparing to a reference genome. The algorithm and function of pkusnp
  is similar to that of SOAPsnp.

2. spermsnp, a specialized software for inferring sperm genotype, which take the diploid heterozgyous 
  SNPs (hetSNP) as prior information and only infer the genotype of sperms on the hetSNP sites. The 
  usage can be found in shell file "cal_sperm_snp.sh" in this directory.
