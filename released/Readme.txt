Well, I just decide to use the mirror repo at sf now.

For those under GFW that cannot access https://code.google.com/p/pirs/ :
Use `git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/pirsim/code pIRS` here.
Or set `/usr/libexec/git-core/git-remote-https` to run through proxy.

However, it seems the default location is:
.git/modules/released/pIRS/
as an bare git repository.
