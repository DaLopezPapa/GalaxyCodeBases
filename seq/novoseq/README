Human Decoy Sequences (37d5)
****************************

Methods
=======

Data collection
---------------

1. GRCh37p4 patches. Download data from:

     ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Eukaryotes/vertebrates_mammals/Homo_sapiens/GRCh37.p4/

   and cut sequences at contiguous 'N' longer then 20bp.

2. BAC/fosmid clones. Download primate sequences (gbpri*) from GenBank 183:

     ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/

   and select human sequences with the DEFINITION field containing words
   "BAC", "clone" or "fosmid", or with the KEYWORDS field containing "HTG".
   Sequences having "LOW.PASS" in the DEFINITION field are excluded.

3. HuRef contigs. Download the HuRef scaffolds from:

     ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/

   and cut at contiguous 'N' longer than 20bp to get contigs. Contigs were
   acquired this way instead of from the ABBA00000000.1 accession because some
   foreign contigs were not used in the scaffold.

4. NA12878 ALLPATH-LG assembly. Download data directly from:

     http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/?val=AEKP


Procedure
---------

1. Stringent alignment. Align WGS/clone sequences to the GRCh37 primary
   assembly plus the alternate sequences and EBV (AC:NC_007605) with the
   following command line:

     bwa bwasw -Hb99 -q199 -r49 hs37a.fa xxx.fa.gz > xxx-b99.sam

2. Relaxed alignment. Align to the same reference with the default BWA-SW
   settings (-b3 -q5 -r2).

3. UnReg-I regions. Filter out alignments with score no greater than 500,
   and then extract unmapped regions no less than 1000bp (selreg.lua).
   Chimeric BACs, contaminated BACs and BACs from cancer cell lines are
   dropped.

4. UnReg-I relaxed alignment. Align UnReg-I to the same reference with the
   default BWA-SW settings. Filter out alignments with identity above f(l),
   where f(l)=min{0.99, 1 / (1 + 0.055 * exp(-8.5e-5 * l))} and l is the
   length of query sequence in the alignment (calsim.lua).

5. UnReg-II regions. Use the same rule in step 3 to extract unmapped regions.

6. UnReg-III regions. Drop an UnReg-II region that is contained in the relaxed
   alignment from step 2 and has mapped flanking sequences longer than 500bp.

7. Deredundancy. Perform all-vs-all alignment with BLAT and drop UnReg-III
   sequences contained in another alignment with identity above f(l).
